## Problem

You are given two positive integers `x` and `y`, denoting the number of coins with values `75` and `10` respectively. Alice and Bob are playing a game where each player must pick coins totaling `115` on their turn. The game starts with Alice. If a player is unable to make the required total, they lose the game. Determine the name of the player who will win if both players play optimally.

## Explanation

The game involves both players trying to optimally pick coins to form a total of `115`. The strategy revolves around checking if itâ€™s possible to continue picking coins with the available amounts. The code provided attempts to simulate this process to determine the winner.

### Approach

1. **Initialization:**
   - Begin with `n` initialized to `0` to keep track of the number of successful turns where a total of `115` was picked.

2. **Game Simulation:**
   - While there are coins available (`x > 0`) and enough coins of value `10` to make up `115` (`y > 3`):
     - A successful turn is executed by decrementing `x` by `1` and `y` by `4` (since the turn involves picking coins totaling `115`, and the optimal combination uses `1` coin of `75` and `4` coins of `10`).
     - Increment the turn counter `n`.

3. **Determine the Winner:**
   - If the total number of successful turns (`n`) is even, Alice will lose, and Bob will win (since Alice makes the first move).
   - If `n` is odd, Alice will win.

### Code

```cpp
        while (x > 0 && y > 3) {
            n++;
            x = x - 1;
            y = y - 4;
        }
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return "Bob";
        }
        return "Alice";
```

- **Time Complexity:** O(min(x, y))
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
